      <p>There are many existing international quality mesure testing food products in order to indicate to all consumers which are higher quality products. Founded in 1961 in Brussels, The international Monde Selection quality award is the oldest[2] in evaluating food quality.[3] During the degustations, the products must meet the following selection criteria, required by the Institute: sensory analysis, bacteriological and chemical analysis, the nutrition and health claims, and the utilisation notice. In short, the judgements are based on the following areas: taste, health, convenience, labelling, packaging, environmental friendliness and innovation.[4] As many consumers rely on manufacturing and processing standards, the Institute Monde Selection takes into account the European Food Law.
